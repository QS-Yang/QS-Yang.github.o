<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

My name is Qisen Yang(Êù®Ê∑áÊ£Æ). I am a first-year Ph.D. student at UC San Diego [Creativity Lab](https://creativity.ucsd.edu/), advised by Prof. [Haijun Xia](https://haijunxia.ucsd.edu/). My research interests focus on the intersection of Visualization and Human-Computer Interaction, especially how to use visualization techniques to facilitate the process of data fetching and data analysis. 

Previously, I entered [Turing Class](http://www.cs.zju.edu.cn/turingclass_en)( Chu Kochen Honors College ), Zhejiang University and obtained my Bachelor's degree in CS. During my undergraduate, I work closely with Prof. [Zhutian Chen](https://chenzhutian.org/) at [VCG](https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/), Prof. [Yingcai Wu](http://www.ycwu.org/) at [ZJUIDG](zjuidg.org), Prof. [Huamin Qu](http://huamin.org/) at [HKUST VisLab](http://vis.cse.ust.hk/)


# üìñ Educations

# üî• News
- *2023.01*: &nbsp;üéâüéâ One paper about gaze-moderated visualization on augmenting sports video was accepted by CHI 2023. We will open source later!
- *2022.07*: &nbsp;üéâüéâ One paper about visualization in argument sports video was accepted by IEEE VIS 2022. My first co-authored paper!

# üíª Research Experience
- *2022.06 - 2023.4* **Undergradute Visiting Research Intern, VisLab, HKUST**

   Advised by Prof. [Huamin Qu](http://huamin.org/). I will work with [Yifang Wang](http://wangyifang.top/about/) to find some interesting interactions between VIS and social computing, especially on voting history.

- *2022.01 - 2022.09*  **Research Intern, VCG, SEAS@Harvard**

   Lead by [Hanspeter Pfister](https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/people), I first work with [Zhutian Chen](https://chenzhutian.org) on exploring how to leverage commentary to create augmented sports videos, which is the future work of [‚ÄúAugmenting Sports Videos with VisCommentator‚Äù](https://viscommentator.github.io). And then we try to find ways to help casual fans better understand basketball games using gaze-moderated embedded visualization.

- *2021.04 - 2022.05*  **Student Research Training Project**, **Zhejiang University**      
   Advised by [Prof. Yingcai Wu](http://www.ycwu.org) at [ZJUIDG](zjuidg.org), we focus on ‚ÄúTac-Pair: visual analytics of anticipation skills for players‚Äù, and developed a system: AnticiViz, using visualization tools to help sports and trainers better understand anticipation behavior of sports.
